    "## 1. Choice of Map\n",
    "For this project I really wanted to do some data wrangling on a place I was very familiar with. Since I'm from Tórshavn in Faroe Islands I first searched OpenStreetMap for data from Faroe Islands. However, I wasn't successful in finding a big enough dataset. I then turned to Copenhagen, a city in which I've spent half my life, and which I love! Luckily I found a dataset and downloaded it (interested readers can download the same dataset from the link at the top).\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Problems Encountered in the Map\n",
    "After downloading the data set, I played around with it for a while. I decided to try and get the data into MongoDB which went relatively smoothly. To get the data into a json format, which can be imported from the MongoDB command line, I used a slightly modified version of the last program written for Lesson 6 of the Data Wrangling with MongoDB course. Getting the data into MongoDB and writing a small script for python really allowed me to get a much better grip on MongoDB, Pymongo, but also the problems of the dataset, which I'll go through one by one.\n",

    "#### Malmö and Other Swedish Data\n",
    "From a discussion I had with a coworker, I wanted to see if I could get a list of all the toilets in Copenhagen, and ran this aggregation:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "> db.cities.aggregate([{'$match': {'amenity': {'$exists': 1}}}, {'$group': {'_id': '$amenity', 'count': {'$sum': 1}}}, {'$sort': {'count': -1}}])\n",
    "```\n",
    "When going through the results I found this \n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "...\n",
    "{ \"_id\" : \"bicycle_pump\", \"count\" : 1 }\n",
    "{ \"_id\" : \"mortuary\", \"count\" : 1 }\n",
    "{ \"_id\" : \"vehicle_ramp\", \"count\" : 1 }\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "I was interested in the bicycle pump because I found it strange that there was only one bicycle pump in this dataset, so I ran the following aggregation command to find the bicycle pump's position:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "> db.cities.aggregate([{'$match': {'amenity': 'bicycle_pump'}}])\n",
    "```\n",
    "which returned the following results:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5668892f0405f363dbb4146d\"), \"pos\" : [ 55.5922202, 13.0019409 ], \"amenity\" : \"bicycle_pump\", \"type\" : \"node\", \"id\" : \"2409034810\", \"created\" : { \"changeset\" : \"17243520\", \"user\" : \"lbschenkel\", \"version\" : \"1\", \"uid\" : \"139044\", \"timestamp\" : \"2013-08-06T16:31:43Z\" } }\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, pluggin this latitude and longitude into http://www.latlong.net/Show-Latitude-Longitude.html\n",
    "returned the following map and position:\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"malmo_bicycle_pump.png\" alt=\"malmo\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "which is obviously in Malmö and not Copenhagen!\n",
    "To find out if this was a single case or if there was more data in my Copenhagen dataset that was actually located in Malmö I ran another aggregation to find all longitudes greater than 12.84:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "> db.cities.find({'pos.1': {'$gte': 12.84}}).count()\n",
    "```\n",
    "which returned a whopping 766528!\n",
    "Comparing this with the total number of documents in the collection:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "> db.cities.find().count()\n",
    "3828468\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which means that approximately 20% of the entire Copenhagen dataset isn't even in Copenhagen!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding this meant that I could remove this data from the database, leaving me with 3061940 documents. But just as I thought all swedish data had been removed I stumbled upon another swedish document. This one was found when I tried to list the different representations of city in an ascending order using the following aggregation:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "> db.cities.aggregate([{'$match': {'address.city': {'$exists': 1}}}, {'$group': {'_id': '$address.city', 'count': {'$sum': 1}}}, {'$sort': {'count': 1}}, {'$limit': 5}])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The results were:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{ \"_id\" : \"Härslöv\", \"count\" : 1 }\n",
    "{ \"_id\" : \"löddeköpinge\", \"count\" : 1 }\n",
    "{ \"_id\" : \"Ørestads Boulevard\", \"count\" : 1 }\n",
    "{ \"_id\" : \"Vallensbaek\", \"count\" : 1 }\n",
    "{ \"_id\" : \"Svogerslev\", \"count\" : 1 }\n",
    "```\n",
    "where the first two results are actually in Sweden!\n",
    "Running a check for the number of documents with the position argument might explain why some points couldn't be removed based on their positions - because they didn't have any.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "> db.cities.find({'pos': {'$exists': 0}}).count()\n",
    "456104\n",
    "```\n",
    "Meaning there are still issues regarding swedish data in the Copenhagen dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Danish Representation of Addresses\n",
    "Another issue I found had to do with the representation of city names. In the data I found that some addresses didn't list city as Copenhagen, but as Copenhagen V or Copenhagen N. In Copenhagen these letters after the city name are used to designate postal codes. However, some of these documents did contain another type of address representation called osak and interested readers can read more about it here: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Da:Addresses. What this means for the representation of addresses and streets is that they can be inconsistent. As an example, by running this find command on the collection:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "> db.cities.find({'osak:municipality_name': {'$exists': 1}})\n",
    "```\n",
    "These are some of the results:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"566888e30405f363db9161fe\"), \"osak:municipality_no\" : \"101\", \"created\" : { \"changeset\" : \"28352913\", \"user\" : \"AWSbot\", \"version\" : \"6\", \"uid\" : \"2184056\", \"timestamp\" : \"2015-01-23T16:15:13Z\" }, \"osak:identifier\" : \"0A3F507A367932B8E0440003BA298018\", \"osak:street_no\" : \"0004\", \"pos\" : [ 55.671612, 12.5594 ], \"osak:street_name\" : \"Abel Cathrines Gade\", \"source\" : \"AWS Web API\", \"osak:revision\" : \"2002-04-07T12:00:00\", \"address\" : { \"city\" : \"København V\", \"street\" : \"Abel Cathrines Gade\", \"housenumber\" : \"21A\", \"postcode\" : \"1654\", \"country\" : \"DK\" }, \"osak:municipality_name\" : \"København\", \"osak:house_no\" : \"21A\", \"type\" : \"node\", \"id\" : \"340483101\" }\n",

    "#### Data Streamlining\n",
    "According to http://danmarksadresser.dk/standarder-adressedata, which handles danish address information, there isn't really any standard for describing danish addresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Standarder for adresser\n",
    "Der findes desværre ingen opdaterede, formelle standarder for Danmarks adresser. Nogle af de vigtigste elementer, som indgår i en adresse, er dog i 2004-2008 standardiseret i det såkaldte OIO-arbejde.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly translated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Standards for addresses\n",
    "Sadly, there is no updated, formal standard for Danish addresses. Some of the important elements, which are a part of an address, were standardized in 2004-2008 in the so-called OIO-work.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The danish OSAK standards (or the lack thereof) for representing documents therefore creates more confusion than necessary. One of the first steps for streamlining the Copenhagen dataset would therefore be to set up a standard for representing addresses, and preferably one similar to the standards of other countries. One important change I feel needs to done is to distinguish cities from postcode districts, so that city names like \"København Ø\" don't occur. Furthermore, nodes without positions, should promply be removed. This would be done to filter out all the non-position nodes located in Sweden. According to information on http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSAK, this OSAK standard is being phased out in favor of a BBR standard, though the implications of this BBR standard, aren't known. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "After working on the data for a couple of days, it is clear to me that the Copenhagen dataset has a lot of issues. I cleaned away many of obvious issues like data from Sweden but there is still much work to be done if one wishes this dataset to be consistent and without any trace of swedish data. I would really like to work more on it, and in the future I hope to use MongoDB along with the data wrangling tools I've picked up over the course of this project to try out some App development."
